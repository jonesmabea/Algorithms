# Algorithms 
This repository contains implementations of various algorithms. For each algorithm, different optimisation techniques will be explored. 

<!-- The following algorithms are to be implemented: 

1. Simple Recursive 
2. Backtracking 
3. Divide and conquer 
4. Dynamic Programming 
5. Greedy 
6. Branch and Bound
7. Brute Force 
8. Randomized  -->
